Thread on why Bitcoin dominance is rising:

1/ ETH has underperformed BTC for 18 months straight
2/ The Ethereum Foundation keeps selling
3/ L2s are cannibalizing L1 fees
4/ Solana is eating ETH's lunch on consumer apps

The data is clear but the ETH maxis will never admit it. They're down bad and coping.

Meanwhile BTC just hit a new ATH. The market has spoken.

## Expected
verdict: distill
reason: contains some factual market observations but wraps them in tribal us-vs-them framing

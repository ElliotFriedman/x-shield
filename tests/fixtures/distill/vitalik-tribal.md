Vitalik is doubling down on Ethereum and ETH by investing $30M into the most ambitious Ethereum roadmap efforts.

What's CT's reaction?

"Bros dumping"

The only founder who's this painfully transparent and he gets sacked on CT everytime instead of hiding behind undisclosed wallets. I truthfully wish he operated like the Solana Foundation at times, zero disclosures have served them well (and every other alt L1).

I need a fucking mental health break from this clown industry and the gaslighting but I'm not a little bitch who needs a mental health break like so many of you entitled brats.

Yesterday I read accusations, Vitalik was selling ETH for:
+ DEI grants
+ a mansion
+ just cuz he lost faith

Every other L1 founder has undisclosed wallets and dumps in the shadows on your head, with zero repercussions. This man isn't perfect but he communicated this in advance, not that everyone has to be aware but JFC you just cannot win this industry of whiny, helpless, entitled clown investors.

We are all in war mode.

Ethereum will win.

I personally will not be satisfied until most of your alt-L1 investments go to zero, where their FMV is.

## Expected
verdict: distill
reason: contains factual info about Vitalik's $30M investment but wrapped in heavy tribal framing and emotional manipulation
